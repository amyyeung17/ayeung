    I'm a learner that believes every experience can be an opportunity to grow from.
    I strive to work towards my goals and improve as much as I can each day, whether it be work-related or personal.
    I'm passionate about helping others accompish their own goals and have worked extensively in education, especially in STEM related fields.

    As a developer, I've been exploring more of the frontend side by working on
    some side-projects. Currently, I am self-learning Vue. Some of my next goals are to brush up on some past languages I've worked with such as Ruby and OCaml. 
    I personally enjoy learning languages and frameworks, finding the process to be valuable in my understanding overall.

    In my downtime, I've been trying to improve my 5k time and playing Pok√©mon Violet or any of the newly released tactical RPG's.
    I'm a big rowing enthuiast from my time spent as a coxswain in college. 
    On the more academic side of my interests, I find anything of cognitive science to be fascinating and am reading The Righteous Mind by Jonathan Haidt.
