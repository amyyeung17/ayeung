 *  A synthesis of artificial intelligence and its usage in healthcare today.
      I briefly delve into the evolution of both the computer and artificial intelligence, 
      discuss some common natural languge processing (NLP) techniques, and examine their applications in dementia, mainly Alzheimer's, research.
      
      Studies have shown early detection of Alzheimer's or Mild Cognitive Impariment (MCI) allow current treatments and preventative care to be more effective. 
      However, most cases are often left unexamined until much later stages when significant impairments have already occurred. Current exams are shown to be
      not as suited towards detecting early cases when administered. While biomarkers are typically accepted as one of the more definitive diagnosis, an examination of this kind is not
      immediately accessible to the general public due to cost restraints. Even then, the presence of such biomarkers are not reliable predictors of dementia and 
      thresholds used for diagnosis are debated. New research has emerged showing the potential of observing syntatic, semantic, and other features of an individual's speech.
      Those diagnosed with Alzheimer's have shown to have a decrease in syntatic complexity and lexical diversity. Furthermore, there have been studies that have shown this method's prospects
      of differentiating between dementia types.
